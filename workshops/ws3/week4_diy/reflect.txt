more details about loops
if else statements 
logic

In order to complete this workshop, few other necessaty topics were covered. First of al,l the "loops' topic were covered in all details. We learned everything about "while", "for" and "do while" loops; about its logic, in which kind of situations it would be convenient to use them and etc. However, we get familiarized with the new topic called "Selection Constructions". The topic provide us with information about types of conditional sentences, where and how to use them. Actually, there are 3 conditional statements: "if", "else if", and "else". When it comes to the "how to use them properly", firstly we have to understand its logic: if the condition of "if" statement is true, it will print its body and skip other statements. If it is not true, it will check other statement like "if else". If they are not true too, the machine will go to the last statement and print it. Moreover, we learned how to properly combine loops with if else statements and its logic too. While doing the workshop, i encountered with the issue of understanding the logic of conditional statements and expecially combining them with loops. That is why i asked an extension for the workshop and tried to learn to logic of them. After doing some researches, i got the logic of selection constructions, but it still confuse me liitle bit.
