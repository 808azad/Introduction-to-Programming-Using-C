In order the complete the workshop 4 few essential topics were covered. First of all, we got introduced with another type of selectional constructions, which related to the "Alternative Path". This was a "Switch statement". The logic of the switch statement is pretty much the same as the logic of the "if-else" statement, but there are plenty of differences between them. The syntax of the "Switch statement" consist of 3 elements: 1.Case, 2.Break and 3.Default. The case is used for defining specific condition, while break is used to exit from the case. Default is used when none of the conditions are met the requirements of switch expression. By contrast with the "if-else", switch statements are used in order to define "simple" conditions. Besides all that, we also learned how to use simple header files. For using header files, we need the actual source code of functions and header files with the prototypes of these functions. Finally, it just needed to be included to the specific file by using "#include" and double quotation marks for the name of the header(#include "utils.h"). To be honest, this workshop seemed to me as the hardest one. While completing DIY part, i encountered with lot of issues, such as how to correctly use the switch statement, how to make a function to calculate the exponent, how to use "if-else" statements in order to exit from a program and display errors, when the input did not match with the required one. However, by doing some researches, i solved the mentioned issues and succesfuly completed the workshop.
