The numerous points the three fundamental topics taught in order to finish this workshop. The first topic, "Types," gave us a thorough description of several datatypes, including char, int, float, and double, as well as how many bytes they contain, their specifiers, and whether they are integral or floating-point. Nevertheless, the topic included details on variables, their structures, their C language declaration, and which values might be sorted in the aforementioned datatypes. The second topic, "Simple Calculations," covered string literals (n), simple input as (scanf), format specifiers and when/how to use them properly, such as (char -%c; int-%d); variable assignment, and simple output as (char -%c; int-%d); (printf). The third topic, "Expressions," demonstrated how to use arithmetic expressions, integral calculations, and floating-point operations (binary +, -, *, and /; unary +, -). The issues I ran into when doing the session were in both the first and second parts. Due to some grammatical errors in the first part, I had trouble submitting. I had considerable trouble calculating the average number of all three courses in the second part.
